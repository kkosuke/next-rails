# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.

/backend/vendor/bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/backend/db/*.sqlite3
/backend/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/backend/log/*
/backend/tmp/*

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/backend/tmp/pids/*

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/backend/storage/*
/backend/tmp/storage/*

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
